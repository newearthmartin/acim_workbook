*LESSON 352*

*Judgement and love are opposites. From one come all the sorrows of the world. But from the other comes the peace of God Himself.*

_Forgiveness looks on sinlessness alone, and judges not. Through this I come to You. Judgement will bind my eyes and make me blind. Yet love, reflected in forgiveness here, reminds me You have given me a way to find Your peace again. I am redeemed when I elect to follow in this way. You have not left me comfortless. I have within me both the memory of You, and One Who leads me to it. Father, I would hear Your Voice, and find Your peace today. For I would love my own Identity, and find in Him the memory of You._
