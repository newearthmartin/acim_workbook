*LESSON 353*

*My eyes, my tongue, my hands, my feet today have but one purpose; to be given Christ to use to bless the world with miracles.*

_Father, I give all that is mine today to Christ, to use in any way that best will serve the purpose that I share with Him. Nothing is mine alone, for He and I have joined in purpose. Thus has learning come almost to its appointed end. A while I work with Him to serve His purpose. Then I lose myself in my Identity, and recognize that Christ is but my Self._
