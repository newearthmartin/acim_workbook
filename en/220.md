*LESSON 220*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(200) There is no peace except the peace of God.

_Let me not wander from the way of peace, for I am lost on other roads than this. But let me follow Him Who leads me home, and peace is certain as the Love of God._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
