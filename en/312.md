*LESSON 312*

*I see all things as I would have them be.*

Perception follows judgement. Having judged, you therefore see what you would look upon. For sight can merely serve to offer you what you would have. It is impossible to overlook what you would see, and fail to see what you have chosen to behold. How surely, therefore, must the real world come to greet the holy sight of anyone who takes the Holy Spirit's purpose as his goal for seeing. And he cannot fail to look upon what Christ would have him see, and share Christ's love for what he looks upon.

_I have no purpose for today except to look upon a liberated world, set free from all the judgements I have made. Father, this is Your Will for me today, and therefore it must be my goal as well._
