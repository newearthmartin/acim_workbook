*LESSON 297*

*Forgiveness is the only gift I give.*

Forgiveness is the only gift I give because it is the only gift I want, and everything I give I give myself. This is salvation's simple formula. And I, who would be saved, would make it mine, to be the way I live within a world that needs salvation, and that will be saved as I accept Atonement for myself.

_Father, how certain are Your ways; how sure their outcome, and how truly faithful is every step in my salvation set already, and accomplished by Your grace. Thanks be to You for Your eternal gifts, and thanks to You for my Identity._
