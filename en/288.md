*LESSON 288*

*Let me forget my brother's past today.*

_This is the thought that leads the way to You, and brings me to my goal. I cannot come to You without my brother. And to know my Source, I first must recognize what You created one with me. My brother's is the hand that leads me on the way to You. His sins are in the past along with mine. And I am saved because the past is gone. Let me not cherish it within my heart, or I will lose the way to walk to You. My brother is my Savior. Let me not attack the Savior You have given me. But let me honor him who bears Your Name, and so remember that It is my own._

Forgive me, then, today. And you will know you have forgiven me if you behold your brother in the light of holiness. He cannot be less holy than can I, and you can not be holier than he.
