*LESSON 280*

*What limits can I lay upon God's Son?*

Whom God created limitless is free. I can invent imprisonment for him, but only in illusions, not in truth. No Thought of God has left Its Father's Mind. No Thought of God is limited at all. No Thought of God but is forever pure. Can I lay limits on the Son of God, whose Father willed that he be limitless, and like Himself in freedom and in love?

_Today let me give honor to Your Son, for thus alone I find the way to You. Father, I lay no limits on the Son You love, and You created limitless. The honor that I give to him is Yours, and what is Yours belongs to me as well._
