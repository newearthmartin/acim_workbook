*LESSON 338*

*I am affected only by my thoughts.*

It needs but this to let salvation come to all the world. For in this single thought is everyone released at last from fear. Now he has learned that no-one frightens him, and nothing can endanger him. He has no enemies, and he is safe from all external things. His thoughts can frighten him, but since these thoughts belong to him alone, he has the power to change them, and exchange each fear thought for a happy thought of love. He crucified himself. Yet God has planned that His beloved Son will be redeemed.

_Your plan is sure, my Father, - only Yours. All other plans will fail. And I will have thoughts that will frighten me until I learn that You have given me the only Thought Which leads me to salvation. Mine alone will fail and lead me nowhere. But the Thought You gave me promises to lead me home, because it holds Your promise to Your Son._
