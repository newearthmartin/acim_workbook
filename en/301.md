*LESSON 301*

*And God Himself shall wipe away all tears.*

_Father, unless I judge I cannot weep. Nor can I suffer pain, or feel I am abandoned and unneeded in the world. This is my home, because I judge it not. And therefore is it only what You will. Let me today behold it uncondemned, through happy eyes forgiveness has released from all distortion. Let me see Your world instead of mine. And all the tears I shed will be forgotten, for their source is gone. Father, I will not judge Your world today._

God's world is happy. Those who look on it can only add their joy to it, and bless it as a cause of further joy in them. We wept because we did not understand. But we have learned the world we saw was false, and we will look upon God's world today.
