*LESSON 242*

*This day is God's. It is my gift to Him.*

I will not lead my life alone today. I do not understand the world. And so to try to lead my life alone must be but foolishness. For there is One Who knows all that is best for me. And He is glad to make no choices for me but the ones that lead to God. This day I give to Him, for I would not delay my coming home, and it is He Who knows the way to Him.

_And so we give today to You. We come with wholly open minds. We do not ask for anything that we may think we want. Give us what You would have received by us. You know all our desires and our needs. And You will give us everything we want and that will help us find the way to You._
