*LESSON 1*

*Nothing I see in this room means anything.*

Now look slowly around you, and practice applying this idea very specifically to whatever you see:

_This table does not mean anything._
_This chair does not mean anything._
_This hand does not mean anything._
_This foot does not mean anything._
_This pen does not mean anything._

Then look farther away from your immediate area, and apply the idea to a wider range:

_That door does not mean anything._
_That body does not mean anything._
_That lamp does not mean anything._
_That sign does not mean anything._
_That shadow does not mean anything._

Notice that these statements are not arranged in any order, and make no allowance for differences in the kinds of things to which they are applied. That is the purpose of the exercise. The statement is merely applied to anything you see. As you practice applying the idea for the day, use it totally indiscriminately. Do not attempt to apply it to everything you see, for these exercises should not become ritualistic. Only be sure that nothing you see is specifically excluded. One thing is like another as far as the application of the idea is concerned.

Each of the first three lessons should not be done more than twice a day, preferably morning and evening. Nor should they be attempted for more than a minute or so, unless that entails a sense of hurry. A comfortable sense of leisure is essential.
