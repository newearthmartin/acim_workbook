*LESSON 265*

*Creation's gentleness is all I see.*

I have indeed misunderstood the world, because I laid my "sins" on it, and saw them looking back at me. How fierce they seemed! And how deceived was I to think that what I feared was in the world, instead of in my mind alone. Today I see the world in the celestial gentleness with which creation shines. There is no fear in it. Let no appearance of my "sins" obscure the light of Heaven, shining on the world. What is reflected here is in God's Mind. The images I see reflect my thoughts. Yet is my mind at one with God's. And so I can perceive creation's gentleness.

_In quiet would I look upon the world, which but reflects Your Thoughts and mine as well. Let me remember that they are the same, and I will see creation's gentleness._
