*LESSON 345*

*I offer only miracles today, for I would have them be returned to me.*

_Father, a miracle reflects Your gifts to me, Your Son. And every one I give returns to me, reminding me the law of love is universal. Even here it takes a form which can be recognized, and seen to work. The miracles I give are given back in just the form I need to help me with the problems I perceive. Father, in Heaven it is different, for there, there are no needs. But here on earth the miracle is closer to Your gifts than any other gift which I can give. Then let me give this gift alone today, which, born of true forgiveness, lights the way that I must travel to remember You._

Peace to all seeking hearts today. The light has come, to offer miracles to bless the tired world. It will find rest today, for we will offer what we have received.
