*LESSON 277*

*Let me not bind Your Son with laws I made.*

_Your Son is free, my Father. Let me not imagine I have bound him with the laws I made to rule the body. He is not subject to any laws I made by which I try to make the body more secure. He is not changed by what is changeable. He is not slave to any laws of time. He is as You created him, because he knows no laws except the Law of Love._

Let us not worship idols, nor believe in any laws idolatry would make to hide the freedom of the Son of God. He is not bound except by his beliefs. Yet what he is is far beyond his faith in slavery or freedom. He is free because he is his Father's Son. And he can not be bound unless God's Truth can lie, and God can will that He deceive Himself.
