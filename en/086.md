*LESSON 86*

These ideas are for review today:

(71) *Only God's plan for salvation will work.*

It is senseless for me to search wildly about for salvation. I have seen it in many people and in many things, but when I reached for it, it was not there. I was mistaken about where it is. I was mistaken about what it is. I will undertake no more idle seeking. Only God's plan for salvation will work. And I will rejoice because His plan can never fail.

These are some suggested forms for applying this idea specifically:

_God's plan for salvation will save me from my perception of this._
_This is no exception in God's plan for my salvation._
_Let me perceive this only in the light of God's plan for salvation._

(72) *Holding grievances is an attack on God's plan for salvation.*

Holding grievances is an attempt to prove that God's plan for salvation will not work. Yet only His plan will work. By holding grievances, I am therefore excluding my only hope of salvation from my awareness. I would no longer defeat my own best interests in this insane way. I would accept God's plan for salvation, and be happy.

Specific applications for this idea might be in these forms:

_I am choosing between misperception and salvation as I look on this._
_If I see grounds for grievances in this, I will not see the grounds for my salvation._
_This calls for salvation, not attack._
