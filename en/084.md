*LESSON 84*

These are the ideas for today's review:

(67) *Love created me like Itself.*

I am in the likeness of my Creator. I cannot suffer, I cannot experience loss, and I cannot die. I am not a body. I would recognize my reality today. I will worship no idols, nor raise my own self-concepts to replace my Self. I am in the likeness of my Creator. Love created me like Itself.

You might find these specific forms helpful in applying the idea:

_Let me not see an illusion of myself in this._
_As I look on this, let me remember my Creator._
_My Creator did not create this as I see it._

(68) *Love holds no grievances.*

Grievances are completely alien to love. Grievances attack love, and keep its light obscure. If I hold grievances I am attacking love, and therefore attacking my Self. My Self thus becomes alien to me. I am determined not to attack my Self today, so that I can remember who I am.

These specific forms for applying this idea would be helpful:

_This is no justification for denying my Self._
_I will not use this to attack love._
_Let this not tempt me to attack myself._
