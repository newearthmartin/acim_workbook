*LESSON 311*

*I judge all things as I would have them be.*

Judgement was made to be a weapon used against the truth. It separates what it is being used against, and sets it off as if it were a thing apart. And then it makes of it what you would have it be. It judges what it cannot understand, because it cannot see totality and therefore judges falsely. Let us not use it today, but make a gift of it to Him Who has a different use for it. He will relieve you of the agony of all the judgements you have made against yourself, and re-establish peace of mind by giving you God's Judgement of His Son.

_Father, we wait with open mind today, to hear Your Judgement of the Son You love. We do not know him, and we cannot judge. And so we let Your Love decide what he whom You created as Your Son must be._
