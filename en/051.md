*LESSON 51*

The review for today covers the following ideas:

(1) *Nothing I see means anything.*

The reason this is so is that I see nothing, and nothing has no meaning. It is necessary that I recognize this, that I may learn to see. What I think I see now is taking the place of vision. I must let it go by realizing that it has no meaning so that vision may take its place.

(2) *I have given what I see all the meaning it has for me.*

I have judged everything I look upon. And it is this and only this that I see. This is not vision. It is merely an illusion of reality, because my judgements have been made quite apart from reality. I am willing to recognize the lack of validity in my judgements, because I want to see. My judgements have hurt me, and I do not want to see according to them.

(3) *I do not understand anything I see.*

How could I understand what I see when I have judged it amiss? What I see is the projection of my own errors of thought. I do not understand what I see because it is not understandable. There is no sense in trying to understand it. But there is every reason to let it go, to make room for what can be seen and understood and loved. I can exchange what I see now for this merely by being willing to do so. Is not this a better choice than the one I made before?

(4) *These thoughts do not mean anything.*

The thoughts of which I am aware do not mean anything because I am trying to think without God. What I call "my" thoughts are not my real thoughts. My real thoughts are the thoughts I think with God. I am not aware of them because I have made "my" thoughts to take their place. I am willing to recognize that "my" thoughts do not mean anything, and to let them go. I choose to have them be replaced by what they were intended to replace. "My" thoughts are meaningless, but all creation lies in the Thoughts I think with God.

(5) *I am never upset for the reason I think.*

I am never upset for the reason I think because I am constantly trying to justify "my" thoughts. I am constantly trying to make them true. I make all things my "enemies," so that my anger is justified and my attacks are warranted. I have not realized how much I have misused everything I see by assigning this role to it. I have done this to defend a thought system which has hurt me, and which I no longer want. I am willing to let it go.
