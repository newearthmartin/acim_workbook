*LESSON 251*

*I am in need of nothing but the truth.*

I sought for many things, and found despair. Now do I seek but one, for in that one is all I need, and only what I need. All that I sought before I needed not, and did not even want. My only need I did not recognize. But now I see that I need only truth. In that, all needs are satisfied, all cravings end, all hopes are finally fulfilled and dreams are gone. Now have I everything that I could need. Now have I everything that I could want. And now at last I find myself at peace.

_And for that peace, our Father, we give thanks. What we denied ourselves You have restored, and only that is what we really want._
