*LESSON 209*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(189) I feel the Love of God within me now.

_The Love of God is what created me. The Love of God is everything I am. The Love of God proclaimed me as His Son. The Love of God within me sets me free._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
