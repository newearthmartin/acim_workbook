*LESSON 323*

*I gladly make the "sacrifice" of fear.*

_Here is the only "sacrifice" You ask of Your beloved Son; You ask him to give up all suffering, all sense of loss and sadness, all anxiety and doubt, and freely let Your Love come streaming in to his awareness, healing him of pain, and giving him Your own eternal joy. Such is the 'sacrifice'You ask of me, and one I gladly make; the only 'cost' of restoration of Your memory to me, for the salvation of the world._

And as we pay the debt we owe to truth – a debt which merely is the letting-go of self-deceptions and of images we worshipped falsely – truth returns to us in wholeness and in joy. We are deceived no longer. Love has now returned to our awareness. And we are at peace again, for fear has gone and only Love remains.
