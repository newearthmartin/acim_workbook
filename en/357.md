*LESSON 357*

*Truth answers every call we make to God, responding first with miracles, and then returning unto us to be Itself.*

_Forgiveness, truth's reflection, tells me how to offer miracles and thus escape the prison house in which I think I live. Your holy Son is pointed out to me, first in my brother; then in me. Your Voice instructs me patiently to hear Your Word and give as I receive. And as I look upon Your Son today, I hear Your Voice instructing me to find the way to You as You appointed that the way shall be:'Behold his sinlessness and be you healed. Look on the Christ in him, and he is healed'._
