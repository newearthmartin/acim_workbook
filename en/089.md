*LESSON 89*

These are our review ideas for today:

(77) *I am entitled to miracles.*

I am entitled to miracles because I am under no laws but God's. His laws release me from all grievances, and replace them with miracles. And I would accept the miracles in place of the grievances, which are but illusions that hide the miracles beyond. Now I would accept only what the laws of God entitle me to have, that I may use it on behalf of the function He has given me.

You might use these suggestions for specific applications of this idea:

_Behind this is a miracle to which I am entitled._
_Let me not hold a grievance against you (name), but offer you the miracle that belongs to you instead._
_Seen truly, this offers me a miracle._

(78) *Let miracles replace all grievances.*

By this idea do I unite my will with the Holy Spirit's, and perceive them as one. By this idea do I accept my release from hell. By this idea do I express my willingness to have all my illusions be replaced with truth, according to God's plan for my salvation. I would make no exceptions and no substitutes. I want all of Heaven and only Heaven, as God wills me to have.

Useful specific forms for applying this idea would be:

_I would not hold this grievance apart from my salvation._
_Let our grievances be replaced by miracles, (name)._
_Beyond this is the miracle by which all my grievances are replaced._
