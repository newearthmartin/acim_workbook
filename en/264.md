*LESSON 264*

*I am surrounded by the Love of God.*

_Father,You stand before me and behind, beside me, in the place I see myself, and everywhere I go. You are in all the things I look upon,the sounds I hear,and every hand that reaches for my own. In You time disappears, and place becomes a meaningless belief. For what surrounds Your Son and keeps him safe is Love Itself. There is no Source but This, and nothing is that does not share Its holiness; that stands beyond Your one creation, or without the Love Which holds all things within Itself. Father,Your Son is like Yourself. We come to You in Your own Name today, to be at peace within Your everlasting Love._

My brothers, join with me in this today. This is salvation's prayer. Must we not join in what will save the world, along with us?
