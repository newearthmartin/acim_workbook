*LESSON 240*

*Fear is not justified in any form.*

Fear is deception. It attests that you have seen yourself as you could never be, and therefore look upon a world which is impossible. Not one thing in this world is true. It does not matter what the form in which it may appear. It witnesses but to your own illusions of yourself. Let us not be deceived today. We are the Son of God. There is no fear in us, for we are each a part of Love Itself.

_How foolish are our fears! Would You allow Your Son to suffer? Give us faith today to recognize Your Son and set him free. Let us forgive him in Your Name, that we may understand his holiness, and feel the love for him that is Your Own as well._
