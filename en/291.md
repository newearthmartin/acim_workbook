*LESSON 291*

*This is a day of stillness and of peace.*

Christ's vision looks through me today. His sight shows me all things forgiven and at peace, and offers this same vision to the world. And I accept this vision in its name, both for myself and for the world as well. What loveliness we look upon today! What holiness we see surrounding us! And it is given us to recognize it is a holiness in which we share; it is the Holiness of God Himself.

_This day my mind is quiet, to receive the Thoughts You offer me. And I accept what comes from You instead of from myself. I do not know the way to You. But You are wholly certain. Father, lead Your Son along the quiet path that ends in You. Let my forgiveness be complete, and let the memory of You return to me._
