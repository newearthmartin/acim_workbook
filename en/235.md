*LESSON 235*

*God in His mercy wills that I be saved.*

I need but look upon all things that seem to hurt me, and with perfect certainty assure myself, "God wills that I be saved from this," and merely watch them disappear. I need but keep in mind my Father's Will for me is only happiness, to find that only happiness has come to me. And I need but remember that His Love surrounds His Son and keeps his sinlessness forever perfect, to be sure that I am saved and safe forever in His arms. I am the Son He loves. And I am saved because God in His mercy wills it so.

_Father, Your holiness is mine. Your Love created me, and made my sinlessness forever part of You. I have no guilt or sin in me, for there is none in You._
