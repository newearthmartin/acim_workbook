*LESSON 285*

*My holiness shines bright and clear today.*

Today I wake with joy, expecting but the happy things of God to come to me. I ask but them to come and realize my invitations will be answered by the thoughts to which they have been sent by me. And I will ask for only joyous things, the instant I accept my holiness. For what would be the use of pain to me; what purpose would my suffering fulfill; and how would grief and loss avail me, if insanity departs from me today, and I accept my holiness instead?

_Father, my holiness is Yours. Let me rejoice in it, and through forgiveness be restored to sanity. Your Son is still as You created him. My holiness is part of me and also part of You. And what can alter Holiness Itself?_
