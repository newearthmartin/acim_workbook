*LESSON 290*

*My present happiness is all I see.*

Unless I look upon what is not there, my present happiness is all I see. Eyes that begin to open see at last. And I would have Christ's vision come to me this very day. What I perceive without God's own correction for the sight I made is frightening and painful to behold. Yet I would not allow my mind to be deceived by the belief the dream I made is real an instant longer. This the day I seek my present happiness, and look on nothing else except the thing I seek.

_With this resolve I come to You, and ask Your strength to hold me up today, while I but do Your Will. You cannot fail to hear me, Father. What I ask have You already given me, and I am sure that I will see my happiness today._
