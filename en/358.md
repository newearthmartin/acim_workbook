*LESSON 358*

*No call to God can be unheard nor left unanswered. And of this I can be sure; His answer is the one I really want.*

_You Who remember what I really am alone remembers what I really want. You speak for God, and so You speak for me. And what You give me comes from God Himself. Your Voice, my Father, then is mine as well, and all I want is what You offer me, in just the form You chose that it be mine. Let me remember all I do not know, and let my voice be still, remembering. But let me not forget Your Love and care, keeping Your promise to Your Son in my awareness always. Let me not forget myself is nothing, but my Self is all._
