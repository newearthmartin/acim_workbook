*LESSON 261*

*God is my refuge and my security.*

I will identify with what I think is refuge and security. I will behold myself where I perceive my strength, and think I live within the citadel where I am safe, and cannot be attacked. Let me today seek not security in danger, nor attempt to find my peace in murderous attack. I live in God. In Him I find my refuge and my strength. In Him is my Identity. In Him is everlasting peace. And only there will I remember Who I really am.

_Let me not seek for idols. I would come, my Father, home to You today. I choose to be as You created me,and find the Son whom You created as my Self._
