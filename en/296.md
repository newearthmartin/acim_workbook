*LESSON 296*

*The Holy Spirit speaks through me today.*

_The Holy Spirit needs my voice today, that all the world may listen to Your Voice, and hear Your Word through me. I am resolved to let You speak through me, for I would use no words but Yours, and have no thoughts which are apart from Yours, for only Yours are true. I would be Savior to the world I made. For having damned it, I would set it free that I may find escape, and hear the Word Your holy Voice will speak to me today._

We teach today what we would learn, and that alone. And so our learning goal becomes an unconflicted one, and possible of easy reach and quick accomplishment. How gladly does the Holy Spirit come to rescue us from hell, when we allow His Teaching to persuade the world, through us, to seek and find the easy path to God!
