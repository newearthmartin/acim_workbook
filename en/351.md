*LESSON 351*

*My sinless brother is my guide to peace. My sinful brother is my guide to pain. And which I choose to see I will behold.*

_Who is my brother but Your holy Son? And if I see him sinful, I proclaim myself a sinner; not a Son of God; alone and friendless in a fearful world. Yet this perception is a choice I make, and can relinquish. I can also see my brother sinless, as Your holy Son. And with this choice I see my sinlessness, my everlasting Comforter and Friend beside me, and my way secure and clear. Choose, then, for me, my Father, through Your Voice. For He alone gives judgement in Your Name._
