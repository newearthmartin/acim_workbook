*LESSON 249*

*Forgiveness ends all suffering and loss.*

Forgiveness paints a picture of a world where suffering is over, loss becomes impossible and anger makes no sense. Attack is gone, and madness has an end. What suffering is now conceivable? What loss can be sustained? The world becomes a place of joy, abundance, charity and endless giving. It is now so like to Heaven that it quickly is transformed into the Light that it reflects. And so the journey which the Son of God began has ended in the Light from Which he came.

_Father, we would return our minds to You. We have betrayed them; held them in a vise of bitterness, and frightened them with thoughts of violence and death. Now would we rest again in You, as You created us._
