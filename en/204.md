*LESSON 204*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(184) The Name of God is my inheritance.

_God's Name reminds me that I am His Son, not slave to time, unbound by laws which rule the world of sick illusions, free in God, forever and forever one with Him._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
