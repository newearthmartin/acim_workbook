*LESSON 347*

*Anger must come from judgement. Judgement is the weapon I would use against myself to keep all miracles away from me.*

_Father, I want what goes against my will, and do not want what is my will to have. Straighten my mind, my Father. It is sick. But You have offered freedom, and I choose to claim Your gift today. And so I give all judgement to the One You gave to me to judge for me. He sees what I behold, and yet He knows the truth. He looks on pain, and yet He understands it is not real, and in His understanding it is healed. He gives the miracles my dreams would hide from my awareness. Let Him judge today. I do not know my will, but He is sure it is Your Own. And He will speak for me, and call Your miracle to come to me._

Listen today. Be very still, and hear the gentle Voice for God assuring you that He has judged you as the Son He loves.
