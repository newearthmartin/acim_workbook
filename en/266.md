*LESSON 266*

*My holy Self abides in you, God's Son.*

_Father,You gave me all Your Sons, to be my Saviors and my Counselors in sight; the Bearers of Your holy Voice to me. In them are You reflected, and in them does Christ look back upon me from my Self. Let not Your Son forget Your holy Name. Let not Your Son forget his holy Source. Let not Your Son forget his name is Yours._

This day we enter into paradise, calling upon God's Name and on our own, acknowledging our Self in each of us, united in the holy Love of God. How many saviors God has given us! How can we lose the way to Him, when He has filled the world with those who point to Him, and given us the sight to look on them?
