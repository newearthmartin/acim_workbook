*LESSON 346*

*Today the peace of God envelops me, and I forget all things except His Love.*

_Father, I wake today with miracles correcting my perception of all things. And so begins the day I share with You as I will share eternity, for time has stepped aside today. I do not seek the things of time, and so I will not look upon them. What I seek today transcends all laws of time and things perceived in time. I would forget all things except Your Love. I would abide in You, and know no laws except Your law of Love. And I would find the peace which You created for Your Son, forgetting all the foolish toys I made as I behold Your glory and my own._

And when the evening comes today, we will remember nothing but the peace of God. For we will learn today what peace is ours when we forget all things except God's Love.
