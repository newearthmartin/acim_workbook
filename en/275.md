*LESSON 275*

*God's healing Voice protects all things today.*

Let us today attend the Voice of God,Which speaks an ancient lesson, no more true today than any other day. Yet has this day been chosen as the time when we will seek and hear and learn and understand. Join me in hearing. For the Voice of God tells us of things we cannot understand alone, nor learn apart. It is in this that all things are protected. And in this the healing of the Voice of God is found.

_Your healing Voice protects all things today, and so I leave all things to You. I need be anxious over nothing. For Your Voice will tell me what to do, and where to go; to whom to speak, and what to say to him; what thoughts to think; what words to give the world. The safety that I bring is given me. Father,Your Voice protects all things through me._
