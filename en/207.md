*LESSON 207*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(187) I bless the world because I bless myself.

_God's blessing shines upon me from within my heart, where He abides.  I need but turn to Him, and every sorrow melts away as I accept His boundless Love for me._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
