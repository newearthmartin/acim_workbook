*LESSON 316*

*All gifts I give my brothers are my own.*

As every gift my brothers give is mine, so every gift I give belongs to me. Each one allows a past mistake to go, and leave no shadow on the holy mind my Father loves. His grace is given me in every gift a brother has received throughout all time, and past all time as well. My treasure-house is full, and angels watch its open doors, that not one gift is lost and only more are added. Let me come to where my treasures are, and enter in where I am truly welcome and at home among the gifts that God has given me.

_Father, I would accept Your gifts today. I do not recognize them. Yet I trust that You Who gave them will provide the means by which I can behold them, see their worth, and cherish only them as what I want._
