*LESSON 213*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(193) All things are lessons God would have me learn.

_A lesson is a miracle which God offers to me, in place of thoughts I made that hurt me. What I learn of Him becomes the way I am set free. And so I choose to learn His lessons, and forget my own._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
