*LESSON 212*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(192) I have a function God would have me fill.

_I seek the function that would set me free from all the vain illusions of the world. Only the function God has given me can offer freedom. Only this I seek, and only this will I accept as mine._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
