*LESSON 205*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(185) I want the peace of God.

_The peace of God is everything I want. The peace of God is my one goal; the aim of all my living here, the end I seek, my purpose and my function and my life while I abide where I am not at home._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
