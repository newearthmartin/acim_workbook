*LESSON 354*

*We stand together, Christ and I, in peace and certainty of purpose. And in Him is His Creator, as He is in me.*

_My oneness with the Christ establishes me as Your Son, beyond the reach of time, and wholly free of every law but Yours. I have no self except the Christ in me. I have no purpose but His own. And He is like His Father. Thus must I be one with You as well as Him. For who is Christ except Your Son as You created Him? And what am I except the Christ in me?_
