*LESSON 305*

*There is a peace that Christ bestows on us.*

Who uses but Christ's vision finds a peace so deep and quiet, undisturbable and wholly changeless, that the world contains no counterpart. Comparisons are still before this peace. And all the world departs in silence, as this peace envelops it, and gently carries it to truth, no more to be the home of fear. For Love has come, and healed the world by giving it Christ's peace.

_Father, the peace of Christ is given us, because it is Your Will that we be saved. Help us today but to accept Your gift, and judge it not. For it has come to us to save us from our judgement on ourselves._
