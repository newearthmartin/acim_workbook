*LESSON 210*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(190) I choose the joy of God instead of pain.

_Pain is my own idea. It is not a thought of God, but one I thought apart from Him and from His Will. His Will is joy and only joy for His beloved Son. And that I choose instead of what I made._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
