*LESSON 348*

*I have no cause for anger or for fear, for You surround me. And in every need that I perceive Your grace suffices me.*

_Father, let me remember You are here, and I am not alone. Surrounding me is everlasting Love. I have no cause for anything except the perfect peace and joy I share with You. What need have I for anger or for fear? Surrounding me is perfect safety. Can I be afraid, when Your Eternal promise goes with me? Surrounding me is perfect sinlessness. What can I fear, when You created me in holiness as perfect as Your own?_

God's grace suffices us in everything that He would have us do. And only that we choose to be our will as well as His.
