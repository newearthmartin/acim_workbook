*LESSON 271*

*Christ's is the vision I will use today.*

Each day, each hour, every instant, I am choosing what I want to look upon, the sounds I want to hear, the witnesses to what I want to be the truth for me. Today I choose to look upon what Christ would have me see, to listen to God's Voice, and seek the witnesses to what is true in God's creation. In Christ's sight, the world and God's creation meet, and as they come together all perception disappears. His kindly sight redeems the world from death. For nothing that He looks on but must live, remembering the Father and the Son; Creator and Creation unified.

_Father, Christ's vision is the way to You. What He beholds invites Your memory to be restored to me. And this I choose to be what I would look upon today._
