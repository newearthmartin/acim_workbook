*LESSON 214*

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*

(194) I place the future in the hands of God.

_The past is gone; the future is not yet. Now am I freed from both.  For what God gives can only be for good. And I accept but what He gives as what belongs to me._

*I am not a body. I am free.*
*For I am still as God created me.*
