*LESSON 361*

*This holy instant would I give to You. Be You in charge. For I would follow You, certain that Your direction gives me peace.*

_If I need a word to help me He will give it to me. If I need a thought, that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a tranquil, open mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in charge by my request. And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks for God my Father and His holy Son._
