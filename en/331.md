*LESSON 331*

*There is no conflict, for my will is Yours.*

_How foolish, Father, to believe Your Son could cause himself to suffer! Could he make a plan for his damnation, and be left without a certain way to his release? You love me, Father. You could never leave me desolate, to die within a world of pain and cruelty. How could I think that Love has left Itself? There is no will except the Will of Love. Fear is a dream, and has no will that can conflict with Yours. Conflict is sleep, and peace awakening. Death is illusion; life, Eternal Truth. There is no opposition to Your Will. There is no conflict, for my will is Yours._

Forgiveness shows us that God's Will is one, and that we share It. Let us look upon the holy sights forgiveness shows today, that we may find the peace of God. Amen.
