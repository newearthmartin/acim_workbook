## Structure

The workbook structure is represented in the `workbook_structure.json` file, which is an array of 365 positions, each one corresponding to each day. Each day is a list of files. Most lessons will be just one file but some lessons have an introduction, a theme, or an epilogue. 

All languages share the same file structure. Lessons are grouped in directories by language.
