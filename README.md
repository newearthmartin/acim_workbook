## Structure

Lessons are grouped in directories by language. There is one file per lesson and also additional texts such as introductions or themes are in separate files. 

The workbook structure is represented in a json file which is an array of 365 positions, each one corresponding to one day. Every day is a list of files. Most lessons will be just one file but some lessons have an introduction, a theme, or an epilogue.
